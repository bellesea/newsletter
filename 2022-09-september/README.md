# üéí üçÉ ‚ú® 

Hey friends!

[Sam](https://github.com/sampoder), Hack Clubber from Singapore, here. It's been a busy couple of weeks in the Hack Club community, I wanted to email all of you with a rundown of what your fellow Hack Clubbers have been up to this past month! 

_(FYI: you're receiving this email because you're in the Hack Club Slack.)_

## üéí Hacking The Back To School

This month, it's been back to school for Hack Clubbers. That's meant the return of homework and late nights for many of us (_ugh._) but also some incredible club meetings, for example, here's @Linkai & @Tinu Vanapamula's meeting from last week:

_(what a turnout that is in Silver Spring, MD! Nice work Linkai & Tinu!)_

To prepare for the new school year, clubs have been busy shipping new websites for themselves. It's always interesting to see each leader's unique take on what a Hack Club is and how they pitch it to prospective members. Here are a couple of my favourites:

- https://edisonhack.club/
- https://phc-three.vercel.app/
- https://cchshackclub.github.io/

## üçÉ Sprig

The big news of the month from HQ was the release of Sprig, a handheld gaming console where every player is a creator! This semester, 430 consoles are going to be manufactured & shipped out to Hack Clubbers who make games.

Want one? (I certainly do!) You can get a Sprig in 3 steps:

:video_game: Build a Sprig game in the online JavaScript game editor

:pullrequest: Make a pull request to add your game to the Sprig gallery in the GitHub repository

:mailbox: Once your PR is merged, get a Sprig kit in your mailbox

It's been so special seeing the Hack Club community banding together to create games on Sprig. On our recent Sprig Jam, I tried my hand at building my own game called The Reactor. The games that everyone's been coming up with are incredible:

Sprig's are starting to ship to everyone who makes a game in October, I'm incredibly excited to get mine & to play all these games on the console!

## ‚ú® The Return of IRL Hackathons 

Personally, what excites me the most in Hack Club right now is the return of IRL high-school hackathons! Hackathons are a big part of how I got into programming and seeing them return in-person is incredible. Last week, for example, @Maggie hosted LelandHacks:

_(Maggie made some of the most incredible swag designs for LelandHacks! No wonder everyone's swarming the swag table.)_

And over the next semester, there's many more high school hackathons in stall across the globe:

- [Los Altos Hacks VI](https://www.losaltoshacks.com/) ~ September 24‚Äì25 in Sunnyvale, CA
- [Sego Lily Hacks](https://www.segolilyhacks.com/) ~ October 7‚Äì8 in Salt Lake City, UT
- [Hack Austin!](https://hackaustin.net/) ~ October 16 in Austin, TX 
- Unite Hacks ~ October 22 in Oakland, CA
- Tri-Valley Hacks ~ October 29‚Äì30 in Pleasanton, CA
- Hack Orlando ~ October 29 in Orlando, FL
- Lion City Hacks ~ December 3 in Singapore

We keep an directory of upcoming hackathons at https://hackathons.hackclub.com, strongly recommend it!

What's amazing is how us Hack Clubbers are working together in #hackathon-organizers to create all these magical hackathons. In that channel we talk about raising money, prizes, food, swag & more! As someone organising my own hackathon, it's means a lot to have a group of friends there to help me along the way. 

On a similar note, just last week, we shared :film_slate: The Assemble Documentary: a film handcrafted by the fabulous @rebecca & @mevin to help answer the question ‚Äúwhat is a hackathon?‚Äú. It showcases the magical experience of attending a hackathon, and our hope is that it can help organizers share what‚Äôs in store for attendees at their hackathons.

Looking to escape school? Here a couple of ways you can get involved in Hack Club:

- Join a Hack Night call! Every Saturday evening (in America, for me its Sunday morning!), we all jump on a Zoom call to hang out and code together. 
- Organise a hackathon using Hack Club Bank and with one of our $500 high-school hackathon grants!
- Bring the hack to your school, by starting a club!
- Procasinate by playing games in Sprig Gallery, or, even better, "productivly procasinate" by making a Sprig game.
- Start a streak on Scrapbook

Thanks for taking the time to read this email! You can help make the next issue here on GitHub. (using a pull request!)

With gratitude,

Sam
