Hey friends! I'm Ishan ([@Ishan](https://hackclub.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=U01ACA3M90C)), I'm 17, and I'm a Hack Clubber emailing you again! A special thank you to Belle for helping out so much with today's edition.

It let's you view multiple dinos at once instead of scrolling through the [hackclub/dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs) repo. I asked Jaden what the motivation behind the [JavaScript project](https://github.com/InternetRamen/dino-explorer) was: _"I made dino explorer to see all the amaazing dinos at once :0"_

Why? Because _"facebook is slow so lets make react fast"_

_"I wanted a high level language with a strong type system that compiles (zig does exactly that) but i wanted to implement my own compiled language"_ - Japroz
