## üëÄ What‚Äôs up at Hack Club this time? üëÄ

Hey friends! I'm Ishan ([@Ishan](https://hackclub.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=U01ACA3M90C)), I'm 17, and I'm a Hack Clubber emailing you again! A special thank you to Belle for helping out so much with today's edition. 

This email is a 5-minute monthly rundown of what your fellow Hack Clubbers have been up to the past month! You're receiving this email because you're in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/).

<img src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM-U03AUPJQKLN-24c58425b85d-512" width="16"> [Jaden](https://jadenhou.me/) made [Dino Explorer](https://dinoexplorer.hackclub.com/), his first ship! It let's you view multiple dinos at once instead of scrolling through the [hackclub/dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs) repo. I asked Jaden what the motivation behind the [JavaScript project](https://github.com/InternetRamen/dino-explorer) was: _"I made dino explorer to see all the amaazing dinos at once :0"_

Why? Because _"facebook is slow so lets make react fast"_

_"I wanted a high level language with a strong type system that compiles (zig does exactly that) but i wanted to implement my own compiled language"_. Truly <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/based/537b2120c51f688d.png" width="16">
