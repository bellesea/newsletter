## üëÄ What‚Äôs up at Hack Club this time? üëÄ

Hey friends! I'm Ishan ([@Ishan](https://hackclub.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=U01ACA3M90C)), I'm 17, and I'm a Hack Clubber emailing you again! A special thank you to Belle for helping out so much with today's edition. 

This email is a 5-minute monthly rundown of what your fellow Hack Clubbers have been up to the past month! You're receiving this email because you're in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/).

<img src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM-U03AUPJQKLN-24c58425b85d-512" width="16"> [Jaden](https://jadenhou.me/) made [Dino Explorer](https://dinoexplorer.hackclub.com/), his first ship! It let's you view multiple dinos at once instead of scrolling through the [hackclub/dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs) repo. I asked Jaden what the motivation behind the [JavaScript project](https://github.com/InternetRamen/dino-explorer) was: _"I made dino explorer to see all the amaazing dinos at once :0"_

<img src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM-U018FMCP79R-e769e492c031-512" width="16"> [Aiden](https://aidenybai.com/) pushed an update to [Million.js](https://millionjs.org/), a lightweight Virtual DOM, that makes React 11 times faster <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/ultrafastparrot/5148eb2f1db74d3b.gif" width="16">. Why? Because _"facebook is slow so lets make react fast"_

_"I wanted a high level language with a strong type system that compiles (zig does exactly that) but i wanted to implement my own compiled language"_. Truly <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/based/537b2120c51f688d.png" width="16">

When asked why he made GuessThatRank, John had a really relatable answer:

### What has milkshakes, projects no one needs and Sam in a dinosaur costume? :eyes:

Yes, I'm talking about Assemble. Or rather, Ian (14) and Sam (17) are:

### TODO: Insert some catchy title for the hackathons grant>
![You get $500, Oprah meme](https://cloud-ncs2ypbyu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/06qcy84.jpeg)


At Assemble, Zach announced that Hack Club and FIRST are offering a $500 grant to high-school hackathons hosted before the end of 2022. It's now accepting applications! All you need is a high-school team, secured venue, and custom website to apply.



### Random things to do while procrastinating:
- Scroll through Orpheus drawings (there are HUNDREDS!!): [github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs)
- Grab a popcorn üçøand join [#movie-nights](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C025QEVNRPW) or share your barebone web creations üï∏ in [#freewrite](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C03TE1RLR7V)
- Play around with a new demo game üéÆ and learn to build games in Sprig: [sprig.hackclub.dev](https://sprig.hackclub.dev)
- Join #amas and help bring super cool people  to Hack Club ü¶Ñ
- Do some good-old lurking üïµÔ∏è and find out if there are other Hack Clubbers in your local area üìç! Hack Clubbers have been meeting up ([#bayarea](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C014M6C0CNA), [#seattle](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C023L02KGHZ), ++) and it looks like so much fun.

Ps. So many profiles are now either neon (thanks Dall-e) or photo portraits which is super cool! Also, apparently people are now sending letters?
